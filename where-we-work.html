                <div class="country-content-wrapper">
                    <div class="country-text">
                        <p>We work in the Matero, Lilanda, and 6-mile to 15-mile communities, as well as the areas surrounding Heroes Stadium, located in and around the capital city of Lusaka, Zambia. Zambia has one of the highest rates of regular alcohol use among young people in low- and middle-income countries, with almost one-third reporting recent experiences of intimate partner violence (WHO, 2018; UNFPA, 2020). This violence often stems from deeply rooted unhealthy beliefs about gender (Heise et al., 2019). The region also faces significant challenges related to the education and employment of young people. For instance, over 36% of youth aged 20 to 24 are unemployed, and more than 80% of Zambians are engaged in the informal sector, where work lacks proper regulations and protections (ILO, 2021).</p>
                        <p>We have partnered with <a href="https://www.builditinternational.org/" target="_blank">Build It International</a>, a vocational training program focused mainly on teaching skilled trades, such as bricklaying, painting, and carpentry.</p>

                        <p>We work in the urban communities of Masvingo district, in the southern region of the country. Masvingo province has an International Wealth Index value of 38.2, which means that most households have few basic material needs met. This region is in the 30th percentile globally for indicators of overall human development, like education, income, and health. Other local efforts are already underway to engage young Zimbabweans into dialogue to reduce violence against women, showing that some young people are ready to challenge traditional gender beliefs and make positive changes in their communities.</p>
                        <p>We have partnered with <a href="http://maspoly.ac.zw/" target="_blank">Masvingo Polytechnic</a>, which offers a wide range of practical skills-based programs for learners to increase opportunities for future employment.</p>

                        <p>We work across multiple disadvantaged communities (Vrygrond, Capricorn Park, Lavender Hill, Steenberg) in and around the Cape Flats area. In Cape Town, more than a third of young people aged 15-24 are unemployed, with high levels of poverty, crime, substance use, mental health issues, and social instability. Use of substances in many communities leads to various health and social problems.</p>
                        <p>We have partnered with the <a href="http://www.sozo.org.za/" target="_blank">SOZO Foundation</a>, which offers 10-month vocational training programs to young people in areas such as construction, baking, or hairstyling, for a period of 10 months. SOZO provides job shadowing and assists beneficiaries with finding employment opportunities. SOZO also teaches their beneficiaries other life skills such as goal setting, financial management, and sexual health.</p>
